FAQ
--------------

- **Why is the plugin not provided in the git repo?**
  
  The total plugin size is 100MB+ because it contains the binary files for Windows, Linux and Mac and hence it is not included.


- **Why is the code not exactly as it is in the video?**
  
  There may be a few changes done off-camera
